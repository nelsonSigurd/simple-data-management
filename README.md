What the Simple Data Management app Does:
This application is a basic data management system designed to store, organize, and retrieve data. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing records related to individuals. 

The main features of the application include:

Viewing Records: Users can view a list of all stored records through the records.html.
Adding Records: Users can add new records by providing details to the form in create.html using required valid inputs for first name, last name, and date of birth.
Updating Records: Users can update existing records with new information.
Deleting Records: Users can delete records that are no longer needed.
The application is built using the Flask web framework and uses a CSV file (people.csv) to store data.
